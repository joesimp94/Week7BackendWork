    <h1>About Pikachu's Prose Palace</h1>
    <p>
      I decided to open a bookshop after a mishap involving my short-lived
      career as a Pokémon trainer. My so-called "legendary" team of Pokémon
      turned out to be anything but legendary, and my battles were more like
      slapstick comedy routines. After one particularly embarrassing defeat to a
      rookie trainer, I realized I might have better luck with books than with
      Poké Balls. Now, my bookshop's mascot, a Pikachu named "Bookachu,"
      occasionally shocks customers with its love for literature instead of
      battling other Pokémon. Who knew that the pages of books could provide a
      more exciting adventure than the world of Pokémon battles?
